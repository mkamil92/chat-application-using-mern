# chat-application-using-mern
I have developed chat-application-using-mern
There are certain steps to run this project Successfully:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- Download and Extrat zip folder and open in VS code.
There are two sides front-end and back-end:
2- Open terminal in root directory of prject which is chat-application-using-mern. then run command:
		npm install
3- open another terminal but inside chat-application-using-mern there's folder of backend. so open terminal in backend folder and run commands:
		npm install
		npm install mongoose
		npm install express
		npm install bycrypt
     npm install redux
once you run these commands now run another command in same terminal of back-end so that back-end execute
		nodemon './index.js'
4- Now for front-end execution go to root directory terminal of peoject which is chat-application-using-mern and run command:
		npm start

Note: As per your versions of react/node maybe you face some problem so solve them accordingly.Otherwise is running well
